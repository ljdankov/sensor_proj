# sensor_proj
The files in here are designed to pull capacitive touch data (and other relevant sensors) from the boards I have been working with (ESP32 and Teensy 3.2).
Files included
  ARDUINO IDE: Teensy 3.2 version, ARDUINO IDE: ESP32 Version, PYTHON Interface
It should be noted that documentation may be somewhat minimal as this repository is mostly for myself and other people I am working with on project

At minimum, note dependencies in the files. The Teensy variant will need the teensy software from: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html
The esp32 variant will require the Arduino IDE software from:
https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32
